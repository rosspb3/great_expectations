GX Cloud provides a web interface for using GX to validate your data without creating and running complex Python code. However,
GX Core can connect to a GX Cloud account if you want to customize or automate your workflows through Python scripts.

### Installation and setup

To deploy a GX Agent, which serves as an intermediary between GX Cloud's interface and your organization's data stores, see [Connect GX Cloud](/cloud/connect/connect_lp.md). The GX Agent serves all GX Cloud users within your organization.  If a GX Agent has already been deployed for your organization, you can use the GX Cloud online application without further installation or setup.

To connect to GX Cloud from a Python script utilizing a GX Core see [Connect to GX Cloud with Python](/cloud/connect/connect_python.md)
